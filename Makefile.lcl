# Local configuration file that provides the system-specific paths needed to compile the C++ utilities.

# Set the base directory where the GDAL RPM installed its files.
PREFIX=/usr/local

# Set the root for GDAL headers, as expected by the mrf_apps/Makefile.
# This points to the same location as PREFIX/include but satisfies the variable requirement.
GDAL_ROOT=/usr/local/include

# Override the library directory to point to lib64
